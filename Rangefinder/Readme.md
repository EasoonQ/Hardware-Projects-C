This is a Arduino based project that measures the range to an object by using an ultrasonic rangefinder and displays the range on an LCD. The rangefinder will have the following features:

1. An ultrasonic rangefinder for measuring distances up to 400cm.

2. Buttons to initiate a range measurement and set distance thresholds.

3. An LCD display for showing the measured range. The display is also used for setting the distance thresholds.

4. A control knob for setting the near and far distance thresholds.

5. A multicolor LED for showing how the measured distance compares to a pair of range thresholds.

6. A buzzer for playing an alarm tone if the distance is less than the near threshold.
